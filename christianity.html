  Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that stems from the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth,
  otherwise known as Christ. Christians believe that Jesus was the son of God and by following his divine example they can have a heavenly
  life both while they are living and while they are dead.

<h3 id="2day"> Christianity Today</h3>
<div>
  There are three main sects of Christianity: Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant.
</div>
<br>
<h3 id="cath">Catholicism </h3>
<img src="http://static-10.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/f691c693-9b1d-4233-bb32-9d32139dabd1-large16x9_ElPasoansCanJoinP_Vale.jpg?1565128267956" align="right" width="350" height="250" title="The current Pope Francis"> <div> This is different than the other branches in that Catholics follow the Pope who is the head of the Catholic church.
Catholics believe in the Eucharist and transubstantiation which is when Catholics eat blessed wine and bread that they believe has
been transformed into the body and blood of Jesus. This tradition comes from the Last Supper when Jesus said that the wine and
bread on the table was his body. </div>

    <h3 id="orth">Orthodox</h3> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ba/e1/c1/bae1c1f2d8b72f0650e3a7cbf4c4e9b2.png" height="350" width="250" title="The symbol for the Orthodox Church" align="left" </div> <div class="text">
    <div class="ortho"> This is another of the main branches of Christianity. The word orthodox comes from the Greek word meaning "right belief."
     Orthodox Christianity is primarily practiced in areas that were once part of the Eastern Roman Emipire. Orthodox Christianity
    shares many of same beliefs as the other branches, but it differs in how they worship and what traditions are practiced. Orthodox
    Christianity stresses the importance of worship and prayer as an essential part of life. Until 1918, Orthodox Christianity
    followed the Julian calender for dates of holidays. The calendar is thirteen days behind the more commonly used Gregorian calender.
    Since 1918, most Orthodox Christians adopted the Gregorian calender for most holidays.</div>

<h3 id="pro"> Protestantism</h3><div><img src="https://reasonabletheology.org/wp-content/uploads/martin-luther-95-theses.jpg" align="right" width="350"height="250"title="Martin Luther nailing his 95 theses to a door"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="text">This is one of the main sects of Christianity. Protestantism was started in 1517 when Martin Luther nailed 95 theses
(or issues with the Catholic church) to a castle in Wittenburg. Protestant sects differ from Catholicism in that they do not follow
the Pope. Some of the major Protestant sects in the United States are Baptist, Methodist, and Pentecostal. One of the main beliefs of Baptist
Protestantism is that baptism, a tradition for babies to clease them of the first sin (Eve eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge). It is believed that without baptism you can not go to heaven. Baptists believe once one can fully profess their
belief and devotion to God then they can get baptized. Methodism is another sect of Protestantism. Its main principles are: all need to be saved; all may be saved; all
 may know themselves saved; all may be saved to the uttermost. Pentecostal Protestantism is another of the major sects in the United States.
  They believe that the Bible and faith in Jesus can transform one's life.</div>
