  <p class="font"> <strong id="Overview"> Sikhism </strong> is the ninth largest religion in the world with 30 million practitioners worldwide that mostly
    live in the Indian state of Punjab.</p>
  <div class="fonty"> It is a monotheistic religion founded by Guru Nanak Dev in Punjab in the 15th century. Sikhs call their faith Gurmat (Punjabi:
    "the Way of the Guru"). According to Sikh tradition, it was founded by Guru Nanak and then led by a succession of nine other Gurus- it is believed that
    all ten Gurus were inhabited by a single spirit. Upon the death of the tenth Guru (Guru Gobind Singh) in 1708, the spirit transferred itself to the sacred
    scripture that Sikhs follow called Guru Granth Sahib ("The Granth as the Guru"), also known as the Adi Granth ("First Volume"). This is considered to be the
    only Guru now.
     </div>

    <h3 id="sects"> Sects: </h3>
    <div class="newfont"> There are a couple sects of Sikhism, but here are three significant ones. </div>
    <div> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTS2P5x4pyZ1PbbOPnH4HVzDjzdBKul6kEpNYoM3DdvmDvciBK-DA" alt="Namdhari Sikhs"
      title="Namdhari Sikhs" align="left" class="namd"> <div class="font1"> The <b> Namdhari </b> sect believes that Guru Granth Sahib was not appointed to be the the tenth Guru- rather,
        Balak Singh of Hazro was nominated instead.
        The Namdhari succession includes Ram Singh, Hari Singh, Partap Singh, and Jagjit Singh. Namdharis commonly believe that Ram Singh (who was exiled from India
        by the British in 1872) is still alive and will return to be a leader once again. They revere the Guru Granth and Dasam Granth, and are strict vegetarians
        that only drink rainwater (or water from a well, river, or lake). They have a distinct style of dress that includes white oval turbans and kachhera, and they
        never wear black or blue.

        alt="Nirankari Sikhs" title="Nirankari Sikhs" align="left" class="nirankari"> <div class="font2" > The <b> Nirankari </b> movement is based on the teachings of Baba Dyal, who was against idolatry and emphasized Nirankar (the formless aspect of the
           divine). It started with Gautam Singh and has had several successors including Darbar Singh, Sahib Rattaji, and Gurdit Singh. They prohibit the use of
           alcohol and tobacco, and do not bury or cremate their dead- rather, they place the corpse in flowing river water. Tensions in 1978 resulted in the
           martyrdom of 13 Sikhs, including their leader, Bhai Fauja Singh.

              <b>  Radha Soami </b>, also known as Radha Satsang or Radha Soami, is a spiritual movement with about 2 million members founded by Shiv Dayal Singh Seth
           in 1869. They do not consider themselves to be Sikhs, but they use Guru Granth Sahib as their holy scripture. They are not initiated into Sikhism through
           the Amrit ceremony, but they do adhere to a vegetarian lifestyle and abstain from alchohol and other intoxicants. The ultimate goal of life according to
           this movement is to merge with the ultimate divine reality, or Soami.

     and presents him with gifts of sweets to express his approval and appreciation. The groom's parents also practice this for the bride. It usually
     takes place a few days prior to the engagement ceremony. </div>
