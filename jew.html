    <p class="font"> <strong> Judaism </strong> is an ancient, monotheistic, Abrahamic ethno-religion with the Torah (the Hebrew Bible) as its foundational
      text.  </p>
    <div class="font"> As a religion, it is characterized by a belief in an omniscient God who revealed himself to Abraham and the other Forefathers, along with Moses and other
       prophets chronicled in the Torah. Generally, it is used to describe the way Jewish people live, comprising of theology, law, and numerous complex cultural traditions. </div>
    <p>
      <div class="font"> In addition to being a religion, Judaism arose out of a singular ethnic group in the Middle East. After their expulsion from Israel, Jews moved to different regions of the world, developing distinct ethnic and genetic identities separate from both </div>
      <div class="font"> Jews in other regions but also the inhabitants of those regions. </div>

      <h3 id="sects"> SECTS AND DENOMINATIONS: </h3>
      <div class="fonty"> Within Judaism, there are many different groups. There are three main sects- Orthodox Judaism (which includes Ultra-Orthodox and Modern
        Orthodox), Conservative, and Reform- and each sect has their own unique interpretation of the Torah and how to live as a Jew in the modern, secular
        world. Orthodox Jews are the most observant, Conservative Jews are less observant, and Reform Jews are the least observant.</div>
        <br>
      <div class="font1"> There are also two main ethnic denominations within Judaism- Ashkenazi and Sephardi. Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of Jews that lived in Central
        and Eastern Europe after being forced to leave Israel, while Sephardi Jews are the descendants of Spanish Jews (who were also forced to leave Israel) who
        fled Spain during the Spanish Inquisition and went to the northen coast of Africa. There are many different denominations of Jews from many different
        places (like China, Ethiopia, other Middle Eastern countries, and South America), but these are the two biggest ones. </div>
      <br>
      <div class="font">  Although both groups are Jewish, they have some different customs and experiences- for example, during the Holocaust, the Ashkenazi Jewish population
        in Europe was decimated, with 6 millions Jews (2/3 of the European Jewish population at the time) murdered, while Sephardi Jews were generally not affected
         as much. </div>

    <h3 id="holidays"> HOLIDAYS: </h3>
    <div class="font"> In Judaism, there are two types of holidays- those commanded in the Torah, and those set by the Rabbis (Jewish spiritual leaders). Because Judaism is based
      on a lunar calendar, all holidays begin at night and end the following night. </div>

    <div class="fonty1"> <b> Shabbos/Shabbat </b>, or the Sabbath, is a weekly day of rest that occurs on the seventh day. On this day, religious Jews
      remember the Biblical creation of the heavens and earth during the sixth day and God's subsequent rest on the seventh day. Observance of the day includes
       refraining from the labors of everyday life and spending time with family and friends. It is observed from before sunset on Friday evening until Saturday
       night. Traditionally,three festive meals are eaten- one osn Friday night, one in the early afternoon on Saturday, and one late in the afternoon on Saturday. Shabbos
      ends with a blessing called Havdalah (Hebrew: "Differentiation/Difference"). The day offers an opportunity to Jews to contemplate their relationship
      with God and the more spiritual aspects of life.

    <div class="fonty"> <b> Rosh Hashanah </b> (Hebrew: "Head/Beginning of the Year") is a two-day holiday that marks the beginning of the Jewish High Holy Days, or
      the Yamim Nora'im ("Days of Awe") and celebrates the beginning of the Jewish civil year. It is on the first of Tishrei, which typically occurs
      in early autumn. Some customs of the day are to sound a shofar (a hollow ram's horn) in synagogue during prayer, and eating symbolic foods like
      apples dipped in honey (symbolizing a sweet new year). </div>

    <di class="fonty"> <b> Yom Kippur </b>, or the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day of the Jewish year, marking the end of the High Holy Days. It is on the
      tenth of Tishrei (nine days after Rosh Hashanah). It is a day of atonement and repentance. Jews traditionally observe the day with a
      25-hour period of fasting and intensive prayer, and they often spend most of the day in synagogue. Ashkenazi Jews have a custom to wear all white
      to symbolize purity. In comparison to normal days, there are five prayer services over the course of the holiday (rather than three).
