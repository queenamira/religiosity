          <div>
            <h2>Who we are:</h2>Religiosity is website created by four teenage girls from the New York City area: Amira, Wajiha, Mawedah, and Anneliese.
            <br>Amira is a Jewish rising senior who is interested in science fiction books and history. She want to get a job in computer science.
            <br>Wajiha is a Muslim rising senior and her interests include listening to music and reading. She wants to work in healthcare.
            <br>Mawedah is a Muslim rising senior and is interested in making the world have more sympathy and movies. Currently, she wants to be a speech pathologist.
            <br>Anneliese is a Jewish rising junior and is interested in theme parks and engineering. She wants to designs rides and lands for theme parks.
            <h3>Why we created Religiosity:</h3>We created this website to help dispell false information about various religions and to have an easy way to learn about some of the major world religions.
            Today, there is so much false information and beliefs about other religions, causing violence and intolerance.
            <br>We wanted to combat this surge of intolerance by providing a website about six major religions in the world, in order to foster more understanding and awareness.
            <br>We hope that the information presented is accurate but take responsibility if it is not.
            <br> Go forth and learn, Holy Knowledge Seekers!
