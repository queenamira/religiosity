  religion in the world. It has many sacred texts written in Sanskrit and other similar languages. Hinduism has had a dominant presence in Southeast Asia for more than a thousand
  years starting in the 4th century CE. In the early 21st century, it had nearly one billion adherents worldwide and was the religion of about 80 percent of India’s population.

        celebrate it because it is part of Indian culture. A sister ties a rakhi (holy thread) around the wrist of her brother in order to pray for
        his prosperity, health and well-being. The brother in return offers gifts and promises to protect his sister from any harm and under every
        circumstance. The festival is also celebrated between brothers and sisters belonging to distant family members, friends, relatives or cousins. </div>

<!-- <p id="marriage"> <h3> Hindu Marriage Customs </h3> </p>
  <div> <strong> 1. The Wedding Date is determined in the stars: </strong> An auspicious time known as the mahurat is fixed for the event before the
     wedding. Astrologists and Pandits(Hindu priests) use the bride and groom's dates of births to calculate the position of planets and stars to
     reflect the ethereal union of the couple. During the ceremony, the gautra (ancestral lineage or ancestor's original clan) of both the bride and
     the groom are announced. Under Hindu law, marriages should not take place if they are within the same clan. </div>

  <div> <strong> 2. Sangeet Is Held: </strong> Sangeet is a pre-party held a few days prior to the actual wedding. Here, the family comes together
    to sing, dance, and revel in the joy of an upcoming union. </div>

  <div> <strong> 5. A Fire Burns in the Center of the Mandap: </strong> A fire is kindled in the center of the mandap. A hindu marriage is not a
    contract but a sacrament. To emphasize the validity of the ceremony, fire is kept as a witness and offerings are made. A bride's brother would
    give her three fistfulls of puffed rice as a wish for his sister's happy marriage. The bride offers the rice to the fire and this offering is known
     as homam. </div>

  <div> <strong> 7.Kanyadaan ~ The Moment The Father Gives The Bride Away ~ : </strong> According to Hindu tradition, a man cannot claim a woman until
    she is offered. During the Kanyadaan, the father ties a long piece of fabric that is attached to the bride and groom's clothes. He also places his
     daughter's hands into the groom's hands as a symbolic gesture and may also pour water into the bride's hand, which will flow through her fingers and into
      the hand of her groom. </div>

  <div> <strong> 8.The Bride and Groom's Garments are Tied Together as They Circle a Fire: </strong> This ceremony is known as the saptapadi. During this,
     the bride and groom have their garments tied together. South Indian couples walk 7 steps together to signify their friendship while North
     Indian couples do 7 circles around a ceremonial fire (saat pheras), with each round signifying a specific blessing they request of the gods.
     Each round is also a vow the couples promise each other. The significance of saptapadi is establishing friendship, which is the basis of a Hindu
     marriage.
